        "1. **LLM Pretraining:**\n",
        "   - Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on extensive text corpora.\n",
        "   - Llama 2 was pretrained on a dataset of 2 trillion tokens, compared to BERT's training on BookCorpus and Wikipedia.\n",
        "   - Pretraining is resource-intensive and time-consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Auto-Regressive Prediction:**\n",
        "   - Llama 2, an auto-regressive model, predicts the next token in a sequence.\n",
        "   - Auto-regressive models lack usefulness in providing instructions, leading to the need for instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fine-Tuning Techniques:**\n",
        "   - Instruction tuning uses two main fine-tuning techniques:\n",
        "     a. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Trained on instruction-response datasets, minimizing differences between generated and actual responses.\n",
        "     b. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Trained to maximize rewards based on human evaluations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **RLHF vs. SFT:**\n",
        "   - RLHF captures complex human preferences but requires careful reward system design and consistent human feedback.\n",
        "   - Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) might be a future alternative to RLHF.\n",
        "   - SFT can be highly effective when the model hasn't encountered specific data during pretraining."

            "['make sure that the area is a safe place, especially if you plan on walking home at night.  It’s always a good idea to practice the buddy system.  Have a friend meet up and walk with you. Research the bus, train, or streetcar routes available in your area to find safe and affordable travel to your destination.  Make sure you check the schedule for your outgoing and return travel.  Some public transportation will cease to run late at night.  Be sure if you take public transportation to the venue that you will also be able to get home late at night. Check the routes.  Even if some public transit is still running late at night, the routing may change.  Some may run express past many of the stops, or not travel all the way to the ends.  Be sure that your stop will still be available when you need it for your return trip. If you are taking public transit in a vulnerable state after drinking, it is always a good idea to travel in groups.  Having friends available is a good way to stay safe and make sure that you reach your destination. This is more expensive option than a taxi or ride share service, but could be a fun and fancy way to stay safe and ensure that you will have a ride home. Plan this service in advance with a scheduled time to pick you up from your home and the venue.  You want to be sure that the service will still be available when you need to get home. This may be easy in a large city, but taxis may be less frequent in smaller towns.  This is especially true late at night, so this is a less reliable option than scheduling a ride in advance.  Have a friend accompany you and help you flag a cab to make sure you are able to get one. Set up a plan to call a friend when you get home to make sure that you made it safely to your destination. If there are no taxis readily available call a local service to send a car to pick you up. You can share a ride with your friends, or other people using the app at the same moment.  If you are in a vulnerable state it is best to share the ride with your friends to make sure you get home safe. You can request the car to yourself rather than sharing rides with strangers. If you travel home on your own or are the last of your group to be dropped off, make plans to call a friend when you get home so they know you made it safely to your destination. There may be a designated driver service in your area which can chauffeur your group.  Make reservations with them in advance and keep their contact information handy while you are drinking.', \"Designating a driver is a very popular tactic to avoid drinking and driving.  It is important to plan in advance, because your brain function will slow down and your decision making skills will be impaired once you start drinking. Decide before you begin drinking that you will not drive.  Figure out who will be getting you home before you leave. Make sure this person is responsible and keep them in your sight while you are drinking.  Have their contact information handy in case you can’t find them when you are ready to leave.  Choose a friend who doesn’t drink alcohol.  You likely have someone in your friend group who doesn’t drink.  This person is the most likely to remain sober. Decide on one person who will remain sober.  You can take turns within your friend group, alternating who will be the designated driver on each occasion.  Be sure that the designated driver actually remains sober.  The person who has drank the least is still not sober. If you don’t have your car with you, you can guarantee that you won’t make the choice to drive it home. If you are drinking at your home.  Give your keys to a responsible friend to ensure that you don't choose to drive somewhere after you have been drinking. It may be tempting to stay longer or leave with someone else.  Stick to the plan you made in advance and only leave with your sober, designated driver.  Keep the phone number of your driver handy in case you can't find them when you are ready to leave. If your designated driver drinks alcohol, find alternate transportation to get home.\", 'If you have been drinking at all you are at least on the spectrum of drunkenness.  You could be showing signs of impairment and slower brain function including lack of motor skills and slower reaction time, leading to the inability to operate a motor vehicle.  Some of these signs could be:  Poor balance or stumbling.  Difficulty speaking clearly and slurred words.  Abnormal behavior leading to you doing things you wouldn’t normally do if you were sober. As soon as you notice that you are showing signs of impairment, give your keys to a friend, the host or the bartender to ensure that you won’t drive until you are sober.  Make sure to only give them your car key.  Hold onto your house keys. If your friend, the host or the bartender are advising you not to drive, you are likely too drunk.  Listen to their advice and acknowledge that they are trying to help you. Bystander intervention is common when it comes to drinking and driving.  Many people will be willing to step in, take your keys and help you get home safely.  If no one if offering to help, you may need to ask.  Take a ride from a sober friend.  It is best to get in a car with someone you trust when you are in this vulnerable state. Allow the host or bartender to call a cab or car service to take you home. If you are having a difficult time finding a safe way to get home, find a place to stay which does not involve you driving.  Ask the host of the party if there is a place you can sleep.  Give them your keys and ask that they keep them in a safe place until the morning. Stay with a friend if they live nearby and are on their way home. Find a hotel within walking distance.  Call them to book a room, or have a friend help you secure one.  Ask the friend if they will walk you to the hotel and make sure you get checked in safely. There are people in your life who care about you and want to be sure that you are safe.  It may seem scary or embarrassing to call your parents or your siblings if you are too drunk to drive, but they will be glad you did.  Your safety is the most important. You may need your phone to call someone for a ride or get help from a friend.  Be sure to charge your phone before you leave the house.  It is also a good idea to bring a charger with you in case your battery dies before the end of the night or you end up staying where you are and need to get home the next morning. You may also want to invest in a portable battery charger for your phone should there not be a power outlet available.  Make sure it is fully charged before you leave your house.  Keep it handy in your pocket or your bag throughout the night.']\n",

Consider whether you have a physical reaction to anger. Look for signs that you may have an emotional reaction. Consider the effects of anger on your body.                  When you experience anger, your body undergoes a chemical process that activates your biological “fight or flight” response. Many people show signs of anger in their bodies, even before they realize that they are feeling anger. Monitoring your outbursts of temper or thinking about what usually sets you off can help you identify your temper triggers.\n",

Some good types of fruits and vegetables to include are:  Cherries Blueberries Tomatoes Squash Peppers Staying hydrated is important for overall good health and it may also help with hair loss. Make sure that you drink between six and eight glasses of water every day to stay hydrated. If you are physically active or sweating, then you will need to drink more water to stay hydrated. Red meat is higher in cholesterol and saturated fat than other protein sources, so it is best to limit your intake of red meat. Instead, stick to lean sources of protein such as skinless poultry, fish, tofu, and beans to give your body (and scalp) the protein that it needs. Allergens may effect different parts of your body and possibly even slow hair growth. If you have a known food allergy, make sure that you are not consuming anything that contains that food as an ingredient. If you suspect that you may be allergic to something, then you may want to ask your doctor about an allergy screening. Identifying any food allergies can help you avoid foods that may be contributing to your hair loss.

            "   1  Excessive amounts of protein won't build muscle mass (the only way to build muscle is to work your muscles), but it will support your goal to lose weight and reduce excess fat.  Lean protein can help support your weight loss and keep you feeling satisfied longer compared to carbohydrates.  In general, women need 46 grams of protein daily and men need about 56 grams of protein daily.  Including 1 serving of protein at each meal and snack can help you meet this goal. A serving of meat, poultry, or fish, should be the size and thickness of the palm of your hand (which is about 3-4 oz). Lean protein to include in your diet can be:  eggs, poultry, low-fat dairy, lean beef, legumes, pork, seafood and tofu. Studies have shown that low-carb diets result in greater initial weight loss and greater fat reduction long-term compared to low-fat diets.  Limiting the amount of carbohydrates you consume can help you lose weight, but specifically reduce the amount of excess fat you carry.  Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods including:  fruit, dairy, legumes, grains and starchy vegetables.  Because they are so wide spread, it's not ideal or safe to go on a very-low or no-carb diet as you would be limiting a large variety of foods.  Aim to consume a moderate amount of carbohydrates, not avoid them. Limit carbohydrates from grains like bread, rice, pasta or crackers as these foods are not as nutrient dense as other carbohydrates like starchy vegetables or fruit.  It's also important to limit grains that are refined or made from white flour like white bread, plain pasta, or white rice. If you're choosing to consume a grain-based food, choose 100% whole grains over refined grains.  Whole grains are higher in fiber and other nutrients that are healthy for you.  Choose foods like: 100% whole grain bread, brown rice, or whole grain oats. If your goal is to lose fat you may be focusing on lean protein and limiting carbs, but it's also important to make sure that you're still eating a fairly balanced diet.  That means including fruits and vegetables as well.  Fruits and vegetables are important parts of a balanced diet because they provide a host of nutrients including:  fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.  Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day.  Aim to have one to two servings of fruit daily which is either 1 small fruit or 1/2 cup chopped fruit.  Also have about three to four servings of vegetables daily which is about 1 cup or 2 cups leafy greens. Studies have shown that both sugar and alcohol can cause weight gain, but specifically increase the amount of excess fat.  Cutting out or limiting these foods may help you lose weight and decrease the amount of excess fat you have.  Current recommendations say to limit alcohol to one glass daily for women and two glasses daily for men.  However, limiting alcohol further is ideal for weight and fat loss.  Limit or avoid foods that are high in sugar like:  candy, cookies, cakes, sweetened beverages (regular soda or sweetened tea), sweetened coffee drinks, fruit juices, or sports/energy drinks. There are a variety of pills on the market that promise a host of dieting benefits — including quick weight and fat reduction.  Diet pills are not regulated by the FDA and may have serious consequences. These fads are not only potentially dangerous; they are also not proven effective.  Some studies conducted by the FDA found that many of these over-the-counter diet pills have been tainted or contaminated with other harmful medications or are a combination of medications that is harmful to your body.  Take great caution prior to consuming any diet pills. Do not take any over-the-counter medications without consulting with your doctor first.  These medications may interfere with your prescription medications or current health conditions. Avoid pills or products that claim quick or easy weight fixes.  For example \"lose 10 pounds in 1 week\" or \"drop 2 pant sizes in 2 days.\"  If it looks easy and too good to be true, it probably is.\n",
            "   2  When you experience anger, your body undergoes a chemical process that activates your biological “fight or flight” response. For many people, a short temper results in a “fight” response due to a chemical and hormonal response in the brain. Many people show signs of anger in their bodies, even before they realize that they are feeling anger.  You may be heading towards an outburst of anger if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:  Tense muscles and clenched jaw Headache or stomachache Increased heart rate Sudden sweating or shaking A dizzy feeling In addition to physical reaction to anger, you will likely begin to experience emotional symptoms before losing your temper. Some emotions that often flare up alongside anger are:  Irritation Sadness or depression Guilt Resentment Anxiety Defensiveness Monitoring your outbursts of temper or thinking about what usually sets you off can help you identify your temper triggers.  A trigger is something that happens that makes you have an automatic reaction.  Triggers are usually tied to past emotions or memories (even if you aren’t consciously aware of them).  Some common triggers for anger include:  Feeling out of control of your own life, another person’s actions, or your environment or situation Believing that someone is trying to manipulate you Getting mad at yourself for making a mistake If you are aware of specific circumstances that are likely to trigger your temper, do your best to avoid them.  You may particularly need to focus on avoidance if you have other factors that may contribute to a shorter temper such as a lack of sleep, another emotionally-straining event, or increased life or job stress. For example, if getting yelled at by your boss is a trigger for your anger, you could avoid the trigger by removing yourself from the situation or asking for a moment to yourself. You can also ask your boss to speak to you more calmly in the future. If you are aware of the emotion or memory that is tied to one of your triggers, try to restructure the memory to lessen the effect of the trigger. For example, you may know that your boss yelling at you is a trigger because you were verbally abused as a child, try disassociating the two kinds of yelling. Convincing yourself that your childhood yelling was different because it only happened in a living room may help you separate it from yelling that you experience in the workplace. If you feel that the symptoms of your anger are escalating, and you seem to be moving from mildly irritated to really angry, remove yourself from the situation if at all possible. If you can remove yourself to be alone, you can use strategies to reduce or redirect your feelings of anger and avoid an outburst.\n",
            "   3  If you discover any of the signs or symptoms of vulvar cancer and are at risk for the disease, see your doctor as soon as possible. Vulvar cancer is very treatable, but early diagnosis is important to minimize the length and severity of treatment.  If you can, see your gynecologist, who is best equipped to diagnose vulvar cancer. If necessary, she will refer you to other doctors or specialists. Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check for signs of vulvar cancer and will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as health habits and past illnesses.  Part of your physical exam may be examining your vulva under a special magnifying device. If your doctor suspects that you have vulvar cancer, she may order tests after conducting your physical exam. These tests are the only way to confirm a diagnosis of vulvar cancer.  The most common test for vulvar cancer is a biopsy. Your doctor will remove a small amount of vulvar cells or tissue and send them for a laboratory to check for signs of cancer.  If tests confirm the diagnosis of vulvar cancer, you may need additional tests to determine if the cancer has spread within your body.  Additional testing may include a pelvic exam, colposcopy, x-rays, CT scan or an MRI, and a lymph node biopsy. Your doctor will prescribe a course of treatment for a diagnosed case of vulvar cancer based on the severity of the disease. There are many different treatment options and they may be successful if diagnosed in the earlier stages of the disease.  The four standard treatments used for vulvar cancer are: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy.  Surgery is the most common treatment for vulvar cancer and can remove all the cancer without damaging the person's sexual function.  Your doctor will suggest a treatment based on the severity of your vulvar cancer. Consider taking part in a clinical trial, which would offer you the opportunity to try one of the new treatment methods. Stages one and two may only require surgery, while stages three and four may require more radical surgery as well as chemotherapy and radiation.\n",
            "   4  Body wraps can temporarily help you shed a pound or two of water weight, resulting in you looking slightly thinner for a short period of time. Note that the results are only temporary, though, and may only last a day or two.  Body wraps are commonly offered at spas. Do an online search for reputable, well-reviewed spas near you to see what’s available. Be sure to ask your spa about the ingredients in the body wrap before-hand. If you have any health conditions and/or are taking medications, consult with your doctor to ensure that none of the ingredients in the body wrap will cause problems for you.  If you have sensitive skin, you’re better off using a clay wrap than a wrap with fragrant oils. Fasting involves abstaining from some or all kinds of food and drink; it can help you temporarily lose a few pounds, but generally the weight will come back on once you start eating again. Fasting for a few days won’t hurt most healthy people, as long as they stay hydrated. Fasting for longer periods of time, however, is dangerous.  A water fast would be to only drink water for a set period of time — not eating or drinking anything else. Another type of fast is to only consume liquids — generally fresh fruit and vegetable juices, and broths. Yet another type of fast is to consume mostly liquids, with one light meal each day — usually comprising vegetables, whole grains, and maybe lean protein.  Don’t fast if you have diabetes; it can lead to dangerous drops and rises in blood sugar. You should also not fast if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you suffer from any chronic health conditions. If you’re unsure about whether you can safely fast, ask your doctor. Shapewear is a word for undergarments made from rigid yet flexible fabrics that are specifically designed to smooth out our trouble zones — flattening the stomach and love handles, pulling in the thighs, and lifting the bum. You can purchase shapewear at most department stores, in the section where you would buy underwear.  Corsets can also pull you in at the stomach and waist and help you look much trimmer. Note that shapewear and corsets — or any extra-tight-fitting clothing — can cause health issues if worn over a prolonged period of time. Health risks include meralgia paresthetica (painful burning and tingling in the thighs); digestion issues, including acid reflux; and an increased risk of blood clots in people who have circulation problems. Your body is capable of retaining up to 5 pounds of water each day. Lowering your sodium intake, increasing your fibre intake, exercising, having your body wrapped, and — perhaps counterintuitively — drinking more water, can all help with shedding water weight. If you are a woman, you’ll likely retain more water when you're menstruating. If you know that you’ll be menstruating during a trip or special day where you want to look your thinnest, you might consider extending your birth control pill if you take the pill (this can postpone your period). If you’re not on the pill, battle water retention by consuming lots of fibre and water, and avoiding sodium.\n",

            "   7  Never try to close a credit card if you still owe money on it. If you want to get rid of a card, stop using it and pay it off before you close the account. You can do this the same way you usually pay your credit card bill. This can be online or by writing a check for the amount owed and mailing it with a copy of your bill to your credit card company. Before closing your card, check online or call in to your lender to check if you have any outstanding rewards balances on your card. You don't want to forgo any potential cash or travel rewards. In some cases, however, this may be unavoidable as rewards may be limited to a certain time of year or value threshold that you haven't yet reached. Take advantage of these rewards if possible, then move on to the next step. You may have to wait on hold for a bit, but this is by far the best way to confirm with a person that your credit card is indeed closed. Tell the company customer service representative that you need to close your card, and be prepared for his attempt to stall you and try to convince you to keep your card. Hold fast, though, and stick to your original intention. The customer service number for your lender is also available on your bill and online. Record your contact with the credit card company. Most companies will give you a service or call number. Write this in addition to the time and date that you spoke to the customer service representative. For extra insurance, record the representative's name and employee number (this is also fairly standard). Your credit card company may try to provide you with an offer to get you to stay. Remember, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to your guns about closing your account, if that's what you want to do. Alternately, you can try bargaining with your provider for lower interest rates and fees. In some cases they may agree to these terms to keep you as a customer.\n",
            "   8  If you have a tendency to talk to yourself in a loud tone that you find embarrassing, consider talking in a quieter tone. Whenever you find yourself self-talking aloud, lower your volume to a level that you are comfortable with and that is not disruptive to those around you. Although thinking out loud is good for your thought process, you do not want to be a nuisance. If you want to help your brain work through a task or memorize a certain bit of information, you might whisper to yourself in a soft tone or go somewhere where you can talk out loud. In some places, thinking out loud may not be appropriate. For example, if you are studying in a quiet library, speaking out loud may earn you some glares. In that case, try going somewhere, like a park, where you can think out loud.  If you need to work through something out loud, consider doing it at home or in your office. Find a space where you will not distract other people. Mindfulness is a way to be present in your current situation. Being mindful when you communicate with people is a way to be curious, kind, and compassionate. It can also help you to avoid lying, hurtful or verbally aggressive language, gossip, and divisive speech. Using mindful communication can also help to improve your relationships. It will improve your ability to listen, respond, and engage with your friends, family, coworkers, and others. Saying what you think can be difficult if you have a tendency to say rude or hurtful things. In that case, practice using your inner monologue around other people. When you are around others, say in your head what you might normally say out loud and, if it is not rude, vocalize that thought. If you are unable to filter what you say, despite your best efforts, you should visit a mental health professional.\n",
            "   9  When a decision is hard, it’s important to identify the reasons why you made it. A pro and con list is a simple way to do that. This allows you to apply quantitative reasoning to your decision by adding up the pros of each alternative and weighing them against the cons.  It’s a good idea to make more than one pro and con list, especially if you’re struggling with a decision. For example, you may need to choose between 2 different vacation destinations, such as an island getaway or a trip to Paris. You can only choose 1, and either would be amazing. This helps you overcome the conflict of having to make a choice between two or more good options. Look for more positives to the alternative that you are choosing and add them to your list.  Let’s say that you decided to go to Paris because you found out a friend would be going at the same time. Rewriting your pro and con list to highlight the pros of Paris will help you avoid the conflict of choosing not to go on the island vacation. In this case, you might add that you will get to spend time with your friend to the pros list. This will make that option seem less appealing in your mind, allowing you to avoid regrets about missing out on it. You will be able to see the option you chose as the clear best choice.   For example, you might add that the island getaway could result in sunburn, might be ruined by tropical weather, and could get lonely without a friend around. This is called “spreading” your alternatives. In effect, you are making your chosen alternative more appealing than the other option(s), which reduces your desire to question the choice. This can help solidify that thought in yourself. Backup your choice by pointing out the pros behind the choice you made, firmly dismissing the other option(s). For example, you could tell a friend about your decision to go to Paris, highlighting the opportunity to make memories with your friend, finally see a city you’ve always dreamed of visiting, and avoiding the dangers of a tropical disturbance. Otherwise, you’ll reawaken your feelings of cognitive dissonance. It can take time to get used to accepting your decisions without regret, especially if you’re an anxious person. However, life is full of hard decisions, and focusing on the positives of what you chose can help.  Keep your focus on the actions you're taking rather than ruminating on your decisions. If you do find yourself feeling discomfort or regret, work through the pro and con activity again to remind yourself that the alternative you chose is the right one. There’s no point in entertaining the choice you didn’t make, as you can’t go back in time. Instead, focus on the next decision you have to make.\n",
            "  10  Peppermint oil may be too strong for you. Read the label of any peppermint oil you choose. This can alert you to contraindications and may prevent a bad reaction. Look for therapeutic grade peppermint oil with contraindications and other warnings. Reading the label of the essential oil closely. For example, you should see a warning about using peppermint oil if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Consider a different brand if you can’t find a label or the one you’ve chosen isn’t therapeutic grade. Peppermint essential oil is very strong and you should only sparingly use a “neat” or undiluted oil on your skin. Carrier oils decrease the strength of peppermint oil. They also moisturize your skin. Choose mild oils such as coconut, olive, avocado, and almond. Mix 7-15 drops of peppermint oil to each fluid once of carrier oil, depending on how strong you want the aroma. Avoid diluting your peppermint oil with water or other liquids. Since peppermint oil can be very strong, it’s important to ensure it doesn’t irritate your skin before you use it. Apply 1-2 drops on the inside of your elbow. Use the peppermint oil if you don’t notice any reactions after 24 hours. Peppermint oil is generally safe for use. This is especially true if you do a patch test. However, you may still have a bad reaction to peppermint oil. If you notice any of the following signs of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention:  Redness or itching Hives Skin that is warm to the touch Blisters Scratchy throat Swelling Red eyes Trouble breathing\n",
            "  11  Before you file your nails, you should thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water to get rid of any film or oil that will disrupt your filing. While there are several types of nail files you can choose, emery boards are both affordable and effective. Choose one with a high grit to get the smoothest finish, around 300-600 grit.  Coarse grits, around 80-100 grit, should only be used with acrylic nails. If you use them with natural nails, they will tear up your nails. Avoid metal files as they can also tear up your natural nails.  Glass, or crystal, files are very effective and can be easily cleaned in the dishwasher. There are many nail shapes to choose from, but the most basic shapes are oval, square, and almond. Deciding what shape you want will depend on what your preference is and what kind of nails you have.  Oval-shaped nails are a great shape for growing out and maintaining your nails.  It’s the most functional since your nails will be least likely to break off in this shape. Oval-shaped nails are symmetrically round at the tip. Square-shaped nails are a great statement and work well with people who have long nails. The square shape comes from filing the nail straight at the tip all the way across the nail. Almond-shaped nails are great for making your fingers look more slender. The shape mimics the curve at the base of your nail.  Have short nails that can’t be shaped? It’s no big deal. Use what you’ve got to work with and apply cuticle oil to them every night to help them grow for future shaping.\n",
            "  12  After your trust level has been built, and you have practiced what you want to say, you will want to begin talking to your boyfriend about your past.  A quiet, solemn setting is a great place to begin talking.  Some places that are great to talk in are: your bedroom, the living room, or in a car when you are not driving.  These different settings should be quiet, and should make it easy to see each other face to face. When people talk about their past, it can sometimes be very scary or sad.  Having a pillow around to hold, and tissues available can make the talk easier and flow without interruption. When the radio or television is on, that can take away from a good, thoughtful conversation.  Movie theaters and restaurants can also be noisy, distracting, and generally not suitable for engaging one another.  Privacy is also a concern.  Sometimes asking a friend to join you can help, but you want to make sure that you and your boyfriend share a moment together as a couple.  After all, the goal of the talk is to make your relationship stronger. Sometimes partners are not receptive to what their other partner is telling them.  Having a strong voice can do the trick well.  Use your prepared statement as written beforehand, keep your notes close by, or try and remember what your notes said.  Going too off script might lead to a long drawn-out conversation that does not accomplish the goal. Make sure the words you choose are clear, and precise.  When your boyfriend gets done listening, he should understand exactly what you have told him. There is no need to get all the information out at once, especially if it something difficult you wish to talk about.  Pace yourself, and remember that your boyfriend is there to first and foremost listen to what you have to say. Remember to introduce the topic subtlety and gradually work in the heavier moments.  Describe the event, related side effects of your past, and how it effects you and the relationship.  Begin the conversation with a slow introduction.  Do not reveal all the details at the beginning.  This can turn your boyfriend off to conversation.  Take it slow, and work through everything you want to say. Make sure that there is open communication between yourself and your boyfriend.  This is not only about you, but also the relationship as a whole.  Stop frequently for your boyfriend to ask questions and comment about what he has heard so far   Try your best to look your boyfriend in the eyes, and make sure he is looking to you as well.  This is the best way to gage emotional or physical reactions. Because you are setting special time aside to tell your boyfriend about your past, it is clear that this information is critical to understanding you as a person.  Explain to your boyfriend why this was crucial to reveal, and how it will possibly shape your future.  Consistently remind your boyfriend that talking about the past is important to you.  By revealing this secret about your past, you are allowing him insight into who you are as a person.  People who are able to do this successfully can work together as a team to not repeat the mistakes of the past. Give examples of how this event has changed the way you go about your daily life.  Forecast into the future any potential problems that may arise if this past experience is not dealt with. This should not be a one sided conversation.  Allow your partner, especially after you are done telling your story, to open up about his feelings, reactions, etc.  Gage your boyfriend's reaction to what you have told him.  If your boyfriend has been well receptive, you may want to open up more and tell him other things about your past.  A dialogue is a great way to build a good relationship. Ask your boyfriend if he wants to tell you something about his past.  This is not about blackmailing him, but rather a way to share open and honestly.  A related past can help you and him better understand one another. Be prepared for either a positive or negative reaction.  Sometimes a boyfriend may not like what he is hearing you tell him.  This is perfectly normal, but something that should be worked on.  Continue to follow up, and ask him to listen.  Take a break, for both of you to process what you have just revealed. You do not want to simply end the dialogue on a depressing tone, or wait to construct reactions later on.  Use this time you have to become more open and honest.  Find resolutions to problems.  If it was a difficult moment in your past that you shared, work with your boyfriend to find a way forward.  This moment does not define you, but it will always be a part of you.  Make sure that any future conversations about the topic are solemn and serious. Perhaps, with your boyfriend, work on a system of visual or physical cues.  Every time your boyfriend or yourself relays one of these cues, they will know he or she is referring to this moment/story.  That way, in the future, you will know when it is appropriate to reengage the topic of conversation. If you do not want to reveal all the information at once, find a good stopping point in the story.  If the relationship is healthy, there will always be time to come back and tell the rest. A kiss or a hug is a nice way to tell your partner that you love them and care about what they have said/listened to.\n",

            "  14  Horizontal stripes help make your body seem rounder instead of long and lean. They accentuate your largest parts and curves, which is a good thing when trying to create curves. Try a wide stripe to help give you some roundness. Black is a slimming color and can emphasize your thin frame, or diminish the curves you do have. Instead, wear bright colors, or even better, patterns that give some texture to your body. If you have a curvy bottom half, but not a curvy top half, then wear a darker color on bottom and a lighter color on top to balance out your shapes. To create an hourglass shape despite your body type, go for styles that cinch at the waist. Make sure to cinch at the thinnest part of your waist. This gives the illusion of more pronounced curves by drawing attention to the smaller waist.  Try a peplum top or dress. This style of dress can help emphasize a curvy silhouette despite your body type. Peplums flare at the hips, and narrow at the waist. Wear a belt. Like a peplum, belts help give the illusion of an hourglass figure by helping to narrow the waist and letting the material flare at the hips. Instead of tight fighting cuts, go for loose, flowing garments. These garments, like cinching the waist, make your waist appear smaller while making the rest of your look curvy. Try shirts with sleeves that add volume, like ruffle sleeves or puffy sleeves. Another great look for an hourglass effect is a wrap shirt. Try maxi dresses, mermaid skirts, tulip skirts, pleated skirts, and skirts with layers to help give the illusion of curves. Also try harem pants and dolman sleeves, or ruffles along the front. Either of these styles work well for increasing curves. Skinny jeans will hug your natural curves no matter how large or small they are, and wide leg jeans provide some width and shape to your lower half.\n",
            "  15  Don't obsess over how clothes make you look. Think about how they make you feel instead. Pick out clothes and accessories that make you feel comfortable and confident. You can follow trends, but only if you love them and how they make you feel. Focus mainly on choosing outfits that show off your personality and make you feel like you can take on the world!  Instead of wondering, “Does this top make me look good?” think, “Do I feel good when I wear this top?” Confident, comfortable people are easy and fun to be around. If you're uncomfortable or insecure about your clothes, your negative energy will show and other people will start to feel awkward around you. If you wear a school uniform, stick to the guidelines and take care of your uniform. Try expressing your personality by doing your hair how you like, if that's allowed at your school. Have fun expressing yourself through clothes after school and on the weekends. Take a bath or shower on a regular basis. Brush your teeth twice a day and brush your hair, too. Wear deodorant to stay fresh. Take good care of your clothes so they stay clean and free of wrinkles.  Don't worry about wearing makeup. A little lip balm or lip gloss is all you need. Ask your parent or guardian to teach you how to do the laundry. They will appreciate the help and you'll have clean clothes whenever you want them. If you join an exclusive clique, you might start acting differently. If you're sitting next to someone from another friend group, you might ignore them because you're not really friends. Don't switch your behavior based on who's around; focus on being your true self no matter who you're with.  When you're around older or younger kids, be just as friendly to them as you are to people your own age. If you change who you are when you find a new group of friends, your old friends will feel left out and sad. They might not like the new person you've become and you'll risk losing their friendship. If you're always true to yourself, you'll be able to form real friendships and people in school will get to know the real you. While it's tempting to pass notes and whisper to your friends, try to pay attention during your classes. Take good notes, participate in hands-on activities, and study for quizzes and tests. Don't be afraid to give it your all in gym class and music lessons. Learn as much as you can and keep an open mind. You might be able to connect with other kids who enjoy or struggle with the same subjects as you!  If you slack off in school, talk badly about your teacher, or complain about hating your classes, some of your classmates might be put off. Work as hard as you can in school. Not only will your skills improve but your classmates will admire you for your willingness to try new things. Confide in a parent, guardian, teacher, or guidance counselor if you're feeling sad and lonely, if you're being bullied, or if you're just not sure how to start making friends. Ask your trusted adult about what you're struggling with, and what you can do to manage your feelings.   If you're worried you aren't popular enough, think carefully about what the word “popular” means to you and talk about this with your trusted adult. You'll probably realize it has less to do with your friendships and more to do with your self-esteem. For instance, you might be jealous of another kid's clothing and lifestyle, or a clique at your school might make you feel bad about yourself, and you think being popular would erase those yucky feelings. These problems can be solved in other ways.\n"

But, that is too time consuming to implement. Another possible approach is feeding your data to a large model for augmentation but that is costly, and requires your prompt to be really good so that model doesn't hallucinate. Moreover, all these tasks at some point were done by someone. So why not use their standard code?\n",
